In this folder you can see the basic setup for running an experiment.
Essentially, write the experiment paraneters in the json - file. The experiments to be done should be in the todo folder

The needed command for running this is:

'python run_experiment.py -f <folder> -gpu <1 if gpu, 0 if cpu>

This will then do all the experiments currently in the todo folder
